Lost track of your applications? Pathfinder brings order to your job search with smart AI tools.

Pathfinder is the first full-stack application crafted by addressing real user complaints about existing job trackers, designed to organize and streamline the job search process. It helps you track applications, manage resumes and contacts, and uses carefully tuned AI tools to automate routine tasks and prepare for interviews, all protected against errors like hallucinations.

The application runs locally on your machine (React + Node.js + SQLite), ensuring complete privacy and control over your data.

## For Developers: Technical Implementation

This section is for those interested in the project's technical architecture.

### Architecture
The project is a **full-stack application** featuring:
- **Client** ‚Üí React, TypeScript
- **Server** ‚Üí Node.js, Express  
- **Database** ‚Üí SQLite (local)

### AI Integration
The AI logic is implemented on the server-side and uses several key approaches:

#### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
Used for resume analysis and company research. The system retrieves relevant information first, then feeds it to a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a response.

#### AI Agent System  
User requests are handled by a system of specialized agents ("Recruiter," "Researcher"), each configured for a specific task.

#### Tool Use
Certain agents (e.g., the "Researcher") can use external tools like the Google Search API to gather live data.

#### Multimodality
The interview simulator works with voice, using speech-to-text and text-to-speech services.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** ‚ñ∏ v18 or newer
- **Package Manager** ‚ñ∏ npm or yarn
- **Google Gemini AI API Key** ‚ñ∏ Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

### Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
./start.sh
```

This script will install dependencies (if needed), start the server and client, and then open the application in your browser.

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KazKozDev/pathfinder.git

   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit the .env file and add your API key
   # GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   cd server && npm install && cd ..
   ```

4. **Start the server** (in a separate terminal)
   ```bash
   cd server && npm start
   ```

5. **Start the client** (in a new terminal)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Environment Variables
