# Issue #4: [Feature] Advanced Resume Management: Multi-Template System

## Description
As a user, I want to be able to choose from a variety of visual templates for my resumes. While I can already create different versions of my resume content, I need the ability to apply different designs and layouts to them.

## Why this is important
Currently, Pathfinder supports different content versions of a resume, but they are all locked into a single visual template. This is a significant limitation. Users in different fields (e.g., creative vs. corporate) require different presentation styles. Competitors like Teal are often criticized for having poor-quality or inflexible templates, creating a clear opportunity for Pathfinder to stand out by offering a superior and flexible templating system. This feature will allow users to select the most appropriate visual presentation for each specific application, increasing their chances of making a strong first impression.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The "Resumes" module is updated to include a gallery of multiple, professionally designed, ATS-friendly resume templates (e.g., "Modern," "Classic," "Creative").
- [ ] When editing a resume, the user can switch between available templates, and their existing content will dynamically repopulate into the new layout.
- [ ] Each saved resume version remembers which template was applied to it, allowing users to manage multiple content versions across multiple design templates simultaneously.
- [ ] The system supports at least 3-5 distinct templates at launch.
- [ ] (Stretch Goal) A simple template editor is available, allowing users to change primary colors and fonts for a selected template.
