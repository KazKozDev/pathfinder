# Issue #5: [Feature] Advanced AI Provider Management & Community Features

## Description
As an open source project, I want features that promote transparency, user control, and community engagement. This includes allowing users to choose their preferred AI provider and leverage templates created by the community.

## Why this is important
Trust is a major issue in this market, as demonstrated by user complaints about Simplify's business practices. By leaning into its open source nature, Pathfinder can build a strong, trust-based relationship with its users. Offering advanced user controls for AI that commercial products won't (like choosing a provider) creates a unique value proposition and fosters a loyal community.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Advanced AI Provider Management (BYOK - Bring Your Own Key):

- [ ] In the "Preferences" section, users can add API keys for multiple AI providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic/Claude, Google Gemini).
- [ ] Users can select which of their configured providers should be the "active" one for all AI-powered features within the app.
- [ ] If a personal API key is provided and selected, all AI-related API calls from the user's account are made using their key and chosen provider.
- [ ] The UI clearly indicates which AI provider is currently active.

### Community Templates Repository:

- [ ] A feature is developed that allows users to submit their resume templates to a community repository.
- [ ] Other users can browse, rate, and use these community-submitted templates in the resume builder.
- [ ] (Optional Stretch Goal) This functionality is extended to include community-shared AI prompts for cover letters or interview prep.
