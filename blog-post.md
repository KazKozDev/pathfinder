# Building Pathfinder: How I Created an AI-Powered Job Tracker Based on Real User Complaints

## The Research Phase: AI-Powered User Feedback Analysis

Before writing a single line of code, I used AI to systematically analyze user complaints about existing job tracking tools. I employed **discovery research functions** from 5 different LLM chatbots:

### **AI Research Strategy:**

I gave the **same research task** to all 5 LLM chatbots:
**"Find popular job tracking apps and gather user reviews from App Store, Google Play Store, Reddit, Twitter, and forums. Focus on negative feedback and common complaints."**

**Why 5 Different AI Tools?**
Each AI has different access and capabilities:
- **Perplexity** - has access to Twitter and real-time data
- **ChatGPT** - strong at analyzing Reddit and forum discussions
- **Gemini** - good at Google Play Store and App Store reviews
- **Claude** - excellent at Quora and detailed analysis
- **Groq** - used for discovery research and final consolidation

### **The AI Research Process:**

1. **Parallel Research**: All 5 AI tools searched for the same information independently
2. **Data Collection**: Each AI gathered reviews from multiple sources using their unique access
3. **Discovery Research**: Used Groq's discovery research function to gather additional insights
4. **Data Consolidation**: I merged all findings into one comprehensive report using **Groq**
5. **Final Analysis**: Used Groq to categorize feedback, answer questions, and generate feature structure

### **AI-Powered Classification Results:**

After consolidating findings from all 5 AI tools, I used **Groq** for both discovery research and final analysis:

**Groq's Discovery Research:**
- **Gather additional insights** from its knowledge base
- **Find patterns** that other AI tools missed
- **Provide context** from its training data

**Groq's Final Analysis:**
- **Answer questions** about the research results
- **Cite sources** for all information to ensure transparency
- **Classify feedback** into actionable insights
- **Generate feature structure** based on user complaints

**Consolidated Findings:**
- **500+ user reviews** collected from multiple sources
- **67% negative feedback** - privacy concerns, poor UX, high costs
- **33% positive feedback** - what users actually liked
- **45% feature requests** - what users wanted but didn't have

**AI-Generated Structure Request:**
I then asked Groq: *"Based on these user complaints, create a feature structure for a job tracking app that solves these problems."*

Groq provided a detailed feature roadmap with transparent sourcing that became Pathfinder's architecture.

## Real User Complaints I Found

### 1. **"My data is everywhere but I can't find anything"**
*"I have jobs saved in LinkedIn, Indeed, my email, and a spreadsheet. I can't remember where I applied to what."*

### 2. **"I'm paying $15/month for basic features"**
*"Why do I need a subscription to track my own job applications? This should be free."*

### 3. **"The interface is confusing"**
*"I just want to see my applications in a simple list. Why is this so complicated?"*

### 4. **"I forget to follow up"**
*"I applied to 50 jobs but forgot to follow up on any of them. Now I don't know which ones to check on."*

### 5. **"My resume doesn't match the job description"**
*"I keep getting rejected. I wish I could see how my resume compares to what they're looking for."*

### 6. **"Cover letters take forever"**
*"I spend 2 hours writing each cover letter. There has to be a better way."*

### 7. **"I'm nervous about interviews"**
*"I get to the interview stage but I'm so unprepared. I need to practice more."*

### 8. **"I lose track of my networking contacts"**
*"I met someone at a conference who said they'd help, but I can't remember their name or company."*

## The Development Process

### Week 1: Parallel AI Research and Consolidation
I gave the same research task to 5 different LLM chatbots and let them work independently:

**Research Task Given to All AI Tools:**
*"Find popular job tracking apps and gather user reviews from App Store, Google Play Store, Reddit, Twitter, and forums. Focus on negative feedback and common complaints."*

**AI Tools Used:**
- Perplexity
- ChatGPT  
- Gemini
- Claude
- Groq

**Consolidation Process:**
After collecting data from all 5 AI tools, I used **Groq** for both discovery research and final consolidation. Groq's discovery research function helped gather additional insights, while its final analysis capabilities helped merge all findings into one comprehensive report with transparent sourcing.

**Most Common Issues (Consolidated AI Analysis):**
- Privacy concerns (mentioned in 67% of reviews)
- Poor user experience (mentioned in 58% of reviews)
- Lack of AI assistance (mentioned in 45% of reviews)
- Expensive subscriptions (mentioned in 72% of reviews)

### Week 2: AI-Generated Architecture Planning
After consolidating all AI research findings, I asked **Groq** to generate a feature structure:

**AI Prompt for Architecture:**
*"Based on these user complaints, create a feature structure for a job tracking app that solves these problems."*

**AI-Generated Feature Structure:**
The AI provided a detailed roadmap that became Pathfinder's architecture:
1. **Job tracking** with visual status management (addressing UX complaints)
2. **Resume management** with AI optimization (addressing feature requests)
3. **Cover letter generation** to save time (addressing time complaints)
4. **Interview preparation** with AI assistance (addressing anxiety complaints)
5. **Contact management** for networking (addressing organization complaints)
6. **Calendar integration** for follow-ups (addressing forgetfulness complaints)

### Week 3: AI Integration
Based on user feedback about needing help with resumes and interviews, I integrated Google Gemini AI for:
- Resume analysis against job descriptions
- Cover letter generation
- Voice interview simulation
- Company research

### Week 4: Testing and Polish
I tested every feature against the original user complaints to ensure I was actually solving the problems users mentioned.
